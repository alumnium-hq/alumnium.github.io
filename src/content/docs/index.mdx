## How it works

<Card title="Write Human-Readable Instructions" icon="pencil">
  Write your test case instructions in plain language with test framework you like. Alumnium provides 2 types of
  commands: `do` and `check`. Use `do` to describe the steps to <b>do</b>. Use `check` to verify the <b>results</b>.

```python title="todo_test.py"
al.do("create task 'buy milk'")
al.do("mark task 'buy milk' as completed")
al.check("task 'buy milk' is completed")
```

<Card title="AI-Powered Test Execution" icon="translate">
  Alumnium’s AI interprets your instructions, generates Selenium code and executes browser interactions. It works with the web page's accessibility tree and a screenshot in case it's no enough.

<Card title="Engineer-Centric Flexibility" icon="warning">
  Alumnium doesn’t write the tests for you — it helps you automate them. Designed for test and software engineers, the
  tool keeps you in control of your test logic while handling the browser interactions.
