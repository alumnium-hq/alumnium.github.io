## How it works

<Card title="Write Human-Readable Instructions" icon="pencil">
Write your test case instructions in plain language with test framework you like. Alumnium provides simple commands:
- Use `do` to describe the steps to <b>perform</b>.
- Use `check` to verify the <b>results</b>.
- Use `get` to <b>extract</b> data from the page.

```python title="todo_test.py"
al.do("create task 'buy milk'")
al.check("task 'buy milk' is pending")
assert al.get("number of pending tasks") == 1
```

<Card title="AI-Powered Test Execution" icon="translate">
  Aluminum's AI interprets your instructions to generate browser interactions and execute them. This process utilizes the web page's accessibility tree and, if needed, a screenshot. Aluminum works with popular AI providers like Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Meta Llama.

<Card title="Engineer-Centric Flexibility" icon="warning">
  Alumnium doesn’t write the tests for you — it helps you automate them. Designed for test and software engineers, the
  tool keeps you in control of your test logic while handling the browser interactions.
